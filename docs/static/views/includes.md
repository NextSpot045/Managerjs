<h1>Manager Include</h1>
<p>Okay, this is simple to make, just using ajax to get content, but now you will not need to use JavaScript methods anymore, you will just need to:</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>
<pre class="mngr-code htmlHigh">
&lt;manager-include file="/path/to/file">&lt;/manager-include>
</pre>
See, it's soo simple
